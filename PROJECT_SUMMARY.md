# Portfolio Website - Design Restoration Summary

## ❄️ Snow Animation & Classic Layout Restored

As requested, the website's background has been returned to the **original falling snow animation**, and the immersive 3D spatial navigation has been disabled to restore the previous user experience.

### 🔄 Key Restorations

#### **1. Classic Snow & Cinematic 3D Render**
- **Sleek Snow Physics**: Glowing snow particles with smooth vertical flow and horizontal sway.
- **Cinematic Hardware Model**: A high-end procedural 3D model with:
  - **Bloom & Glow**: Integrated UnrealBloom post-processing for a cinematic neon engine glow.
  - **Reflexive Materials**: Clearcoat physical materials on the CPU die and heat spreaders for realistic "heavy" metal reflections.
  - **Frosted PCB**: Transparent acrylic-style base board with complex gold capacitor detailing.
  - **Dynamic Engine**: A pulsing torus "core" that serves as the visual engine of the piece.
- **Interactive Parallax**: Weighted 3D movement that responds to mouse position with cinematic easing.

#### **2. Standard Smooth Scrolling**
- **Disabled 3D Spacing**: Sections no longer rotate or scale along the Z-axis during scroll. This restores the classic "clean stack" feel.
- **Standard Reveal Animations**: Re-implemented the standard Y-axis fade and slide-up animations for sections as they enter the view.
- **Perspective Reset**: Removed the 3D perspective from the body, returning the interface to a polished 2D design.

#### **3. Maintained Premium Assets**
- **High-End Project Images**: We have kept the professional 3D-generated project card images (Portfolio, Resume, Contact) to ensure the design remains premium.
- **Bento Grid Layout**: The modern, asymmetric layout for the projects section is preserved.
- **Refined Styles**: The "Deep Space" color palette, glassmorphism, and magnetic buttons are still active, ensuring the site looks modern while being less distracting.

### 🚀 **Current Status**

✅ **Visuals Simplified & Polished**
- **Animation**: Falling Snow
- **UI State**: Static Premium (Standard Scroll)
- **Design System**: Deep Space / Glassmorphism

The website is now perfectly balanced between your favorite animation and a professional, modern layout.
